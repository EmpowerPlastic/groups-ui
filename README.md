# Cosmos Groups UI

UI for Cosmos groups module

# Local Setup

1. `yarn install`
2. copy over the config `cp .env.local.example .env.local`
3. `yarn dev` to run the repo

## Install Cosmos-SDK

`git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk` and within that directory:

1. `git checkout v0.46.1` (or current tagged 0.46 release branch)
2. `make build`

### For Darwin / MacOS:

3. `sudo mv build/simd $GOPATH/bin`
4. `sudo ln -s $GOPATH/bin/simd /usr/local/bin/simd`

### For Linux (untested)

3. `sudo mv build/simd $HOME/go/bin`

## Makefile commands

1. `make local-clean` - wipe prior local data
2. `make local-init` - set up local user wallets / accounts, seed funds
3. `make local-start` - run local node
4. `make bank-send` - send funds to the wallet address listed below

## Keplr

You'll need to import generated wallet info into Keplr in order to test features:

# Architecture

This project is organized by [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principals:

```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚atoms
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚molecules
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚organisms
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚templates
 â”— ðŸ“‚pages
```

Some relevant notes / Highlights:

- Outer padding and margin should be set by parents components - ie, an `Atom` should not have `margin` set on the outer element - instead, it would be set by its parent component
- `Atoms` and `Molecules` have `index.ts` barrel files for convenience (ie `import { Box, Button } from '@/atoms'`), but `Organisms`, `Templates`, and `Pages` do not. This is to avoid circular imports which can impact code splitting

## Types

TODO: Explain telescope / cosmos package and UI prefix vs non-prefixed

## Library Resources

- [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/) - UI Components
- [Valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/) - global state
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) - Query caching
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) - form validation

## Linting

`yarn lint` - format with Prettier, fix linting errors

## Storybook

Storybook is installed for this project (not all components are inside it yet), but there's currently a bug with vite - to get working, you might have to clear cache after installing local deps:

[This issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/6338) seems relevant

```
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/storybook/
```
